# Github Repo Ground Rules

1. Merging changes to sub-main
   
```text
Please merge your latest branches to the sub-main branch(trunk/development) and leave the main branch untouched. We will merge sub-main with main once sub-main is stable and runnable.

This is to ensure that the main branch will always be a stable fallback in the event that there are problems with sub-main.
```
